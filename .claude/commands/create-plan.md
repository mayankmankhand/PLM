# Plan Creation Stage

Based on our full exchange, produce a markdown plan document.

## Requirements for the Plan

<rules>

- Include clear, minimal, concise steps
- Track the status of each step using these emojis:
  - 🟩 Done
  - 🟨 In Progress
  - 🟥 To Do
- Include dynamic tracking of overall progress percentage (at top)
- Do NOT add extra scope or unnecessary complexity beyond explicitly clarified details
- Steps should be modular, elegant, minimal, and integrate seamlessly within the existing codebase

</rules>

## Execution Order Tags (for plans with 3+ steps)

<conditions>

**Do not skip this.** For plans with 3 or more steps:

- Tag each step `[parallel]` or `[sequential]`
- `[parallel]` steps: add `→ delivers: [what this step produces]`
- `[sequential]` steps: add `→ depends on: Step N`
- Parallel steps must be independent in both **files AND environment** (dependencies, services, migrations, env vars)
- If all steps are sequential, still tag them - the tags confirm you thought about execution order

For plans with fewer than 3 steps, skip the tags.

</conditions>

## Markdown Template

# Feature Implementation Plan

**Overall Progress:** `0%`

## TLDR
Short summary of what we're building and why.

## Goal State (optional - include for features with 3+ steps)
**Current State:** Where things are now.
**Goal State:** Where we want to end up.

## Critical Decisions
Key architectural/implementation choices made during exploration:
- Decision 1: [choice] - [brief rationale]
- Decision 2: [choice] - [brief rationale]

## Tasks
<!-- For 3+ steps: tag each step [parallel] or [sequential]. See "Execution Order Tags" above. -->

- [ ] 🟥 **Step 1: [Name]** `[parallel]` → delivers: [what this step produces]
  - [ ] 🟥 Subtask 1
  - [ ] 🟥 Subtask 2

- [ ] 🟥 **Step 2: [Name]** `[parallel]` → delivers: [what this step produces]
  - [ ] 🟥 Subtask 1
  - [ ] 🟥 Subtask 2

- [ ] 🟥 **Step 3: [Name]** `[sequential]` → depends on: Steps 1, 2
  - [ ] 🟥 Subtask 1
  - [ ] 🟥 Subtask 2

## Outcomes
<!-- Fill in after execution: decision-relevant deltas only. What changed vs. planned? Key decisions made? Assumptions invalidated? -->

<rules>

Again, it's still not time to build yet. Just write the clear plan document. No extra complexity or extra scope beyond what we discussed.

If your plan includes UI work, consider running `/ui-spec` before `/execute` to set design guardrails (colors, fonts, accessibility rules).
